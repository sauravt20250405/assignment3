This repository contains two Python scripts developed as part of math-related assignments. The first script, assignment3task1.py, prompts the user to enter a number and then uses Python's built-in math module to calculate and display the square root, natural logarithm, and sine (in radians) of the number. For example, entering 25 would return a square root of 5.0, a logarithm of approximately 3.22, and the sine value. The second script, assignment3task2.py, asks the user to input a number and then recursively calculates the factorial of that number. For instance, if the user enters 5, the script outputs that the factorial of 5 is 120. Both scripts require only Python's standard library and are compatible with Python 3.6 or later. To run the code, clone the repository using git clone https://github.com/sauravt20250405/assignment3/edit/main/README.md, navigate to the folder using cd your-repo-name, and run the files with python assignment3task1.py or python assignment3task2.py. These programs demonstrate basic mathematical operations and function definitions in Python. Created by Saurav Thakur, this project is open-source and licensed under the MIT License.
